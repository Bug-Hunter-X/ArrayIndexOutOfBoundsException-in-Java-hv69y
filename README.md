# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond the array's valid index range. This leads to a runtime exception.

The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code, addressing the out-of-bounds access and preventing the error.
